## Comprehensive Code Review

Run a full project audit combining dead code detection, redundancy analysis, and best practice enforcement for the Baton CLI monorepo.

### Phase 1: Dead Code Analysis

Run `bun run dead-code 2>&1` and parse the results. Then manually check for:
- Unused adapters, schemas, commands, and utility functions
- Refer to the find-dead-code skill for the full checklist

### Phase 2: Redundancy Scan

Search for duplicate logic, near-identical adapter implementations, and consolidation opportunities.
- Refer to the find-redundancy skill for patterns to check

### Phase 3: Best Practices & Security

Review code against stack conventions:
- Refer to the review-code skill for the full checklist
- Check the CLI patterns checklist (`checklists/cli-patterns.md`)
- Check the core conventions checklist (`checklists/core-conventions.md`)

### Phase 4: Compile Report

Save findings to a report file with this structure:

```markdown
